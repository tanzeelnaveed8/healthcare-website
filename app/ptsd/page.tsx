        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that is triggered by a terrifying event â€” either experiencing it or witnessing it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Many people who survive severely traumatic events will develop PTSD. Survivors of combat are the most frequent victims, but it is also experienced by those who have been through other traumatic experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          PTSD can also be diagnosed in people who have learned about severe trauma or threat suffered by someone close to them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time and good self-care, they usually get better. Stressful experiences of ordinary life, such as divorce or serious illness, are excluded from this definition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          However, if the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and cause significant problems in social, work situations, and relationships, it may indicate PTSD.
