        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          As part of our persistent, relentless approach to help our patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alongside providing rTMS, we are proud to announce we are the first private Esketamine clinic in the North West of the UK.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Esketamine nasal spray has recently been licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK as a treatment for moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression, also referred to as "difficult to treat depression."
        </p>

        {/* How it Works */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">How does Esketamine Nasal Spray work?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Esketamine nasal spray is the first licensed antidepressant in 30 years with a different mechanism of action from other available antidepressants. It works on the glutamate system of the brain. What is also remarkable is that some patients start feeling an improvement in their depressive symptoms as early as 24 hours from the first dose.
        </p>

        {/* Treatment Involvement */}
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What does the treatment involve?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Patients will go through a detailed assessment with a Consultant Psychiatrist to assess suitability for Esketamine. Following this, they will need to come to the clinic twice a week for the first 4 weeks, followed by once a week for the following 4 weeks. After this, treatment options will be discussed with the Consultant Psychiatrist based on the clientâ€™s preference and needs. All treatments are supervised by our healthcare professionals, and patients can leave in approximately 2 hours post-treatment once the readiness-to-leave checklist is completed and the healthcare professional is satisfied.
        </p>
